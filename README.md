## üìã Overview

The Anonymous Research Ethics Review Platform revolutionizes how research ethics proposals are evaluated by combining blockchain transparency with privacy-preserving cryptography. Using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE), sensitive research data and reviewer assessments remain confidential while maintaining the integrity of the peer review process.

## üîë Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

This platform leverages **FHE technology** to enable computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

- Research proposals' sensitive details (risk levels, ethics scores) remain encrypted on-chain
- Reviewer credentials and qualifications are protected
- Anonymous reviews are submitted and processed in encrypted form
- Final decisions are calculated on encrypted data, preserving complete confidentiality

### Anonymous Research Ethics Review - Privacy-Preserving Research Ethics Assessment

The platform provides a **privacy-first approach to research ethics evaluation**:

- **Confidential Submissions**: Researchers submit proposals with encrypted risk assessments and ethics scores
- **Anonymous Peer Review**: Reviewers evaluate proposals without revealing their identity or bias
- **Blind Evaluation**: Reviewers cannot see each other's assessments until finalization
- **Transparent Outcomes**: While data remains private, the review process is auditable on blockchain
- **Decentralized Governance**: No central authority controls the review process

## üèóÔ∏è Smart Contract Architecture

### FHE-Enabled Contract

**Contract Address:** `0x96104da4AEfA1ba63ab994d87143Cf2130E06ef8`

**Network:** Sepolia Testnet

The smart contract implements:

```solidity
- Research Proposal Management (encrypted risk/ethics data)
- Anonymous Reviewer Registration (encrypted credentials)
- Confidential Review Submission (encrypted ratings)
- Automated Decision Processing (FHE computations)
- Role-Based Access Control
```

### Key Features

#### For Researchers
- **Submit Research Proposals** with encrypted risk and ethics assessments
- **Track Review Progress** without exposing sensitive details
- **Receive Final Decisions** with transparent justification

#### For Reviewers
- **Anonymous Registration** with encrypted qualifications
- **Confidential Evaluation** of proposals
- **Protected Identity** throughout the review process
- **Reputation System** without compromising anonymity

#### For Administrators
- **Assign Reviewers** to proposals based on encrypted qualifications
- **Monitor Review Progress** without accessing confidential data
- **Ensure Process Integrity** through blockchain immutability

## üéØ Use Cases

### 1. Medical Research Ethics
Evaluate sensitive medical research proposals involving human subjects while protecting patient data and institutional identities.

### 2. Cross-Institutional Collaboration
Enable researchers from multiple institutions to participate in ethics review without revealing institutional affiliations or competitive research directions.

### 3. Whistleblower-Friendly Reviews
Allow anonymous submission of ethically questionable research practices for peer review without fear of retaliation.

### 4. International Research Standards
Facilitate global research ethics assessment while respecting regional privacy regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).

## üîê Privacy Guarantees

### What Remains Private (Encrypted)
- Research risk levels and ethics scores
- Reviewer experience and qualifications
- Individual review ratings and recommendations
- Interim decision calculations

### What Is Public (Transparent)
- Proposal submission timestamps
- Number of assigned reviewers
- Review completion status
- Final approval/rejection outcomes
- Contract audit trail

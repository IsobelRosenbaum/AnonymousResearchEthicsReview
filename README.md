# Anonymous Research Ethics Review Platform

A decentralized platform for conducting confidential peer review of research ethics proposals using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology on blockchain.

## üî¨ Overview

The Anonymous Research Ethics Review Platform revolutionizes the research ethics approval process by providing a transparent yet privacy-preserving system for evaluating research proposals. Using advanced FHE smart contracts, the platform ensures that sensitive ethical assessments remain confidential while maintaining the integrity and verifiability of the review process.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### Privacy-Preserving Ethics Assessment

This platform addresses a critical challenge in research ethics: maintaining reviewer anonymity and protecting sensitive evaluation data while ensuring accountability and transparency in the decision-making process.

**Key Privacy Features:**
- **Encrypted Risk Assessments**: Research risk levels (1-10 scale) are encrypted using FHE, ensuring only authorized parties can access sensitivity scores
- **Confidential Ethics Scores**: Self-assessed ethics compliance scores (1-100 scale) remain private during the review process
- **Anonymous Reviewer Credentials**: Reviewer qualifications and experience levels are encrypted to prevent bias
- **Private Review Ratings**: Individual ethics ratings and risk assessments from reviewers are encrypted until final decision

### FHE Smart Contract Architecture

The platform leverages Fully Homomorphic Encryption through the fhEVM library, enabling computation on encrypted data without revealing the underlying information.

**Contract Address (Sepolia Testnet):**
```
0x96104da4AEfA1ba63ab994d87143Cf2130E06ef8
```

**Core FHE Operations:**
1. **Encrypted Proposal Submission**: Research proposals include encrypted risk levels and ethics scores
2. **Anonymous Reviewer Registration**: Reviewers register with encrypted experience levels and qualification scores
3. **Confidential Review Process**: All review ratings and assessments are encrypted on-chain
4. **Privacy-Preserving Decision Making**: Final ethics decisions are computed using FHE operations on encrypted review data

### Workflow

**1. Research Proposal Submission**
- Researchers submit proposals with encrypted risk and ethics assessments
- Review deadline is established (7-90 days)
- Proposal enters "Submitted" status

**2. Reviewer Assignment**
- Platform administrators assign 2-5 qualified reviewers to each proposal
- Reviewers are selected based on encrypted qualification scores
- Proposal status updates to "Under Review"

**3. Anonymous Review Process**
- Assigned reviewers submit confidential evaluations including:
  - Ethics rating (1-10): Compliance with ethical standards
  - Risk assessment (1-10): Potential risks to participants or community
  - Recommendation: Reject, Requires Revision, or Approve

**4. Automated Decision**
- Once all reviews are submitted, the smart contract processes encrypted data
- Final decision reached through majority voting mechanism
- Proposal status updated to: Approved, Rejected, or Requires Revision

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Smart Contract Components

**Data Structures:**
- `ResearchProposal`: Contains encrypted risk levels, ethics scores, and review metadata
- `AnonymousReviewer`: Stores encrypted reviewer credentials and performance metrics
- `ConfidentialReview`: Holds encrypted review ratings and recommendations

**Key Functions:**
- `submitResearchProposal()`: Submit new proposal with encrypted data
- `registerAsReviewer()`: Register as reviewer with encrypted credentials
- `submitAnonymousReview()`: Submit confidential review assessment
- `assignReviewersToProposal()`: Admin function to assign reviewers
- `processEthicsDecision()`: Automated decision making on encrypted reviews

### Privacy Guarantees

**Access Control:**
- FHE ACL (Access Control List) system manages who can decrypt specific data
- Proposal submitters can only decrypt their own proposal data
- Reviewers cannot see other reviewers' assessments
- Platform admin cannot access encrypted review content

**Decryption Flow:**
- Individual encrypted values require proper authorization
- Final decisions use FHE batch decryption with cryptographic proof validation
- All decryption operations are logged on-chain for auditability

## üîê Security Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Review**: Reviewers remain anonymous to prevent retaliation or bias
- **Tamper-Proof Records**: All proposals and reviews are immutably stored on blockchain
- **Verifiable Randomness**: Reviewer performance scores use verifiable random functions
- **Multi-Reviewer Consensus**: Requires 2-5 independent reviews for decision validity
- **Time-Locked Reviews**: Enforced deadlines prevent review manipulation
